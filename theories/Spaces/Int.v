(** * The Integers *)

(** ** Definition *)

(** We define the integers as two copies of [nat] stuck together around a [zero]. *)
Inductive Int : Type0 :=
| negS : nat -> Int
| zero : Int
| posS : nat -> Int.

(** We can convert a [nat] to an [Int] by mapping [0] to [zero] and [S n] to [posS n]. *)
Definition int_of_nat (n : nat) :=
  match n with
  | O => zero
  | S n => posS n
  end.

(** We declare this conversion as a coercion so we can freely use [nat]s in statements about integers. *)
Coercion int_of_nat : nat >-> Int.

(** ** Number Notations *)

(** Here we define some printing and parsing functions that convert the integers between numeral representations so that we can use notations such as [123] for [posS 122] and [-123] for [negS 122]. *)

(** Printing *)
Definition int_to_number_int (n : Int) : Numeral.int :=
  match n with
  | posS n => Numeral.IntDec (Decimal.Pos (Nat.to_uint (S n)))
  | zero => Numeral.IntDec (Decimal.Pos (Nat.to_uint 0))
  | negS n => Numeral.IntDec (Decimal.Neg (Nat.to_uint (S n)))
  end.

(** Parsing *)
Definition int_of_number_int (d : Numeral.int) :=
  match d with
  | Numeral.IntDec (Decimal.Pos d) => int_of_nat (Nat.of_uint d)
  | Numeral.IntDec (Decimal.Neg d) => negS (pred (Nat.of_uint d))
  | Numeral.IntHex (Hexadecimal.Pos u) => int_of_nat (Nat.of_hex_uint u)
  | Numeral.IntHex (Hexadecimal.Neg u) => negS (pred (Nat.of_hex_uint u))
  end.

Number Notation Int int_of_number_int int_to_number_int : int_scope.
